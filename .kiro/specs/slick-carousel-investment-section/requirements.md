# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate the Slick Carousel library (https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) into the "What We Offer" section of the website to create an interactive, sliding UI for displaying investment options (Bonds, Mutual Funds, and SDIs). The carousel will allow users to browse through investment cards horizontally, improving the user experience on both desktop and mobile devices by making the content more engaging and accessible.
